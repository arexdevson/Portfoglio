Meus projetos de curioso

Hello there!
On this Folder we have 6 projects which i've made with so much care to reach some aspects like:
 - 2 Data Analysis projects
 - Linear Regression to predict sales
 - K-Means to create clusters to identify the diabetes clients
 - A process to create QRCode
 - Getting some titles from a sports website (i've used this script so a friend of mine could get some inspirations about an english title to a sport category)
 
 Some other examples that i can share some notes with you guys are:
 - Comission automation (in resume i get an excel file and calculate it accordingly with my company specifities) - using openpyxl,os and pandas library
 - Webscraping: Monthly i need to access a platform which give me a coupon info about our clients and get these info, but it's almost 600 clients per month and on the past i've been doing it click-by-click...so i've automated it using selenium to get these info while i do other reports. - mainly using selenium library
 
 libraries:
- Pandas
- Selenium
- Datetime
- Pyautogui
- openpyxl
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- time
- seaborn
- sklearn (linear regression)
- sklearn (random forest)
- sklearn.cluster import KMeans
- Plotly

and so on.. these are some of the main things that i`ve brought on these files.
Hope you enjoy it !!
